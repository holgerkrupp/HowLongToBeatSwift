A simple package to read data from HowLongToBeat.com

## How to use

Create a instance of HLTBRequest() and perform search(searchTerm: String, extactMatch:Bool = true) on it using the Name of he Game

```swift
            let hltb = await HLTBRequest()
            do{
                let games = try await hltb.search(searchTerm: searchName)
            }catch{
                print(error)
            }
```

the return will be an array of games that fit the search term with their playtimes for different playmodes. If exactMatch is kept unchanged (= true), the list of games will be filtered to contain only the ones where the Game title is an exact match to the search Term. Times are given as Seconds.
